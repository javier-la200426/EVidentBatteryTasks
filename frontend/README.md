# Frontend (React + Vite)

This is the frontend UI for the Role-Based Task Tracker.  
It uses Vite, TailwindCSS, and React.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

We include automated tests for:
- âœ… Role-based access control (submitter can't approve tasks)
- âœ… UI behavior (TaskForm input + button visible)

### Run tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npx vitest run
